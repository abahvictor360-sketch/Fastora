 * every content fetch below is wrapped in `safely`, so a backend that is
 * briefly down during a build yields a sitemap containing only the six
 * hardcoded static routes — and the build still reports success. Search
 * engines would then be told the site has six pages, indefinitely.
 *
 * An hour-long revalidate means the same outage costs at most an hour of a
 * thin sitemap instead of persisting until someone happens to redeploy.
